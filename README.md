JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts
===================
>Following *Udemy Course* ["JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts"](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript).
>
>
>The following are notes from documentation, articles, and personal observations/opinions regarding concepts brought up in the course.
>

Objects
-------------
>
>**Object:**
>
>*A collection of name value pairs*
>
>The simplest definition when talking about **Javascript**
>

>
> **NAME/VALUE PAIR:**
>
>*A name which maps to a unique value*
>
>The name may be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given **context**.
>That value may be more name/value pairs.
>
>
>

The Global Environment and The Global Object
-------------
>  
>**Execution Context (Global)**
>
>The *Execution Context* will provide 2 things to you:
>- **Global Object**
>- Special variable **'this'**
>
>The *javaScript Engine* creates these 2 things for you, whenever your code is run because the code is wrapped in **execution context** .
>
>**Global Object (window)** = **'this'**
>
>*Global* in *javaScript* basically means: **"Not inside a Function"** .
>
>So, any *global* variable or function will be accessible on the *window* object.
>```
>// example code
>var a = 'Hello World';
>```
>
>```
>// accessing the example code via chrome dev tools
>a
>"Hello World"
>window.a
>"Hello World"
>```
>

>
>**Execution Context** is Created (*CREATION PHASE*)
>In the creation phase we have:
>- Global Object
>- 'this'
>- Outer Environment
>
>As the parse is running through your code, it recognizes where you have created *variables* and where you have created *functions*.
>It sets up the Memory Space for Variables and Functions, which is sometimes called "*Hoisting*"
>
>So those *variables* and *functions* exist in memory, and when you execute line by line it can access them.
>But, variables are treated differently from functions.
>Functions will be placed into *memory space* in there entirety, while variables are set in the *Execution Phase*.
>In other words, the variable, though in memory space will not be set to a specific value until it is in the execution phase. Until that time, it will be set to a placeholder value of ```undefined```.
>
>You can see in the following example that logging ```a``` to the console outputs the value of ```undefined``` rather than an actual error.
>
> ```
>// example js code
>
> b();
>console.log(a);
>
>var a = 'Hello World';
>
>function b() {
>  console.log('Called b!');
>}
>
> ```
>
>
>
>```
>// output of example code
>Called b!
>undefined
>```
