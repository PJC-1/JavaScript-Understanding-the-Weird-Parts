Objects
-------------

>**Object:**
>
>*A collection of name value pairs*
>
>The simplest definition when talking about **Javascript**
>

>
> **NAME/VALUE PAIR:**
>
>*A name which maps to a unique value*
>
>The name may be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given **context**.
>That value may be more name/value pairs.

The Global Environment and The Global Object
-------------
>  
>**Execution Context (Global)**
>
>The *Execution Context* will provide 2 things to you:
>- **Global Object**
>- Special variable **'this'**
>
>The *javaScript Engine* creates these 2 things for you, whenever your code is run because the code is wrapped in **execution context** .
